                    Task 01: Hey there

Listen, Slipper:
I heard those mole grandpas have some tiny shiny coins
in their lil chests.. Bring goldy to green sack to
complete the Task.

Move with arrows, basicly. Hit up twice to double jump.
Double jump is very usefull, be sure to use it !
And don't let grandpas catch you. Be careful.
The more gold you carry the slower you are.
